changed domain and service name from **jambox** to **jamhub** (https://jambox.online to https://jamhub.io accordingly). the reason i do that is `io` domain `jambox.io` has been already taken a week ago, `online` domain seems to be a bullshit, `io` is top, so i decided to rename this pet-project

Heya! I implemented midi-over-websocket server and webapp for remote music collaboration and jam. I use it with my friends to mock ideas, harmonizing melodies and live jam online. There's also granular synth for creating atmospheres. Hope you will enjoy it!

# some marketing tests

Heya guys! I created a little browser app to jam with friends online with low latency.
my friends and i live in different cities so we use it for remote music collaboration.
Check demo at my youtube channel, hope you'll enjoy it

your should definitely try jamhub. check out demo at my youtube channel, i created midi streaming with low-latency just in browser, so you needn't install anything. just connect midi-device, share the room link with students and that's it. average latency is 10-20ms , i can play rachmaninov and others hear it immediately as we're in one room

If you want to jam with friends using MIDI devices, check out Jamhub — remote music collaboration app that works entirely in browser. Check out my youtube channel, i prepared a quick demo and overview. it's free and open-source, hope you'll enjoy it.

> @fletcherist delightful project! I spent now longer than I dare to admit toying around with it. :) I noticed that I get ~1200ms ping, but as I didn't try it with another real person, I don't know how badly that would behave. Didn't try running own instance of it, but if occasion arises, I might do that. :)
